        <h3>Ongoing Research Projects</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Overseas Canadians Voting e-Toolkit</strong> is part of a
          series of ongoing research projects that strive to be curated,
          non-partisan resources for Canadians seeking to better navigate our
          political institutions. Each toolkit aims to make the electoral
          process more transparent, accessible, and meaningfulâ€”particularly for
          Canadians living abroad.
