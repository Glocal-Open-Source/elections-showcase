          . It empowers Canadians to ask questions about how government works,
          how decisions are made, and how they can meaningfully participate in
          public life.

        <p>
          The tool collects real questions from the public, lets users vote on
          the ones they find most relevant, and forwards these to the appropriate
          elected representatives or institutions. It helps bridge the
          communication gap between citizens and policymakers while fostering a
          culture of democratic curiosity and accountability.
        </p>

        <p>
          Common questions include topics such as the difference between MPs and
          Senators, how federal and provincial powers interact, or why Canada is
          a constitutional monarchy. Each question helps reveal where civic
          understanding can be deepened and where clearer information from
          public institutions could make a difference.

          Ask Eager Beaver strengthens civic literacy by turning curiosity into
          participation. It supports the democratic objectives of Elections Canada
          and other institutions by helping Canadians understand not only{" "}
